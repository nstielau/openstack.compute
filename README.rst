Python bindings to the Rackspace Cloud Servers API
==================================================

This is a client for the OpenStack Compute API used by Rackspace Cloud and
others. There's a Python API (the ```openstack.compute`` module), and a
command-line program (installed as ``openstack-compute``). Each implements the
entire OpenStack Compute API (as well as a few Rackspace-only addons).

`Full documentation is available`__.

__ http://openstackcompute.rtfd.org/

You'll also probably want to read `Rackspace's API guide`__ (PDF) -- the first
bit, at least -- to get an idea of the concepts. Rackspace is doing the cloud
hosting thing a bit differently from Amazon, and if you get the concepts this
library should make more sense.

Development takes place on GitHub__. Bug reports and patches may be filed there.

Command-line API
----------------

Installing this package gets you a shell command, ``openstack-compute``, that
you can use to interact with Rackspace.

You'll need to provide your Rackspace username and API key. You can do this
with the ``--username`` and ``--apikey`` params, but it's easier to just set
them as environment variables::

    export OPENSTACK_COMPUTE_USERNAME=jacobian
    export OPENSTACK_COMPUTE_APIKEY=yadayada

You'll find complete documentation on the shell by running
``cloudservers help``::

    usage: openstack-compute [--username USERNAME] [--apikey APIKEY] <subcommand> ...

    Command-line interface to the OpenStack Compute API.

      --apikey APIKEY       Defaults to env[OPENSTACK_COMPUTE_APIKEY].

    See "openstack-compute help COMMAND" for help on a specific command.

Python API
----------

There's also a `complete Python API`__.

__ http://openstackcompute.rtfd.org/

By way of a quick-start::

    >>> import openstack.compute
    >>> compute = openstack.compute.Compute(USERNAME, API_KEY)
    >>> compute.flavors.list()
    [...]
    >>> compute.servers.list()
    [...]
    >>> s = compute.servers.create(image=2, flavor=1, name='myserver')

    ... time passes ...

    >>> s.reboot()

    ... time passes ...

    >>> s.delete()

FAQ
---

What's wrong with libcloud?

    Nothing! However, as a cross-service binding it's by definition lowest
    common denominator; I needed access to the OpenStack-specific APIs (shared
    IP groups, image snapshots, resizing, etc.). I also wanted a command-line
    utility.
